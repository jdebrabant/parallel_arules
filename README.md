This is the code for the PARMA algorithm, described in M. Riondato, J.A.
DeBrabant, R. Fonseca, and E. Upfal, "PARMA: A Parallel Randomized Algorithm for
Approximate Association Rules Mining in MapReduce", ACM CIKM'12.

The code was written by Matteo Riondato <matteo@cs.brown.edu> and Justin A.
DeBrabant <debrabant@cs.brown.edu>.
